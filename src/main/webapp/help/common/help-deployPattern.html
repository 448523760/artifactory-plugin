    New line or comma separated paths to build artifacts that will be published to Artifactory. <br/>
    Supports Ant-style wildcards mapping to target directories. E.g.:<br/>
    <b>**/*.zip=>winFiles</b> - Deploys all zip files under the working directory to the winFiles directory of the target
    repository, maintaining the original relative path for each file.<br/>
    <b>unix/*.tgz</b> - Deploys all tgz files under the unix directory to the root directory of the target repository,
    maintaining the original relative path for each file.<br/>
    <b>unix/**=>/ux-x64</b> - Deploys all files under the unix directory to the ux-x64 directory of the target repository,
    as a flat list of files.<br/>
    are target directories.

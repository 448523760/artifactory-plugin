<div>
    When checked a build parameter named PARENT_BUILD_${JOB_NAME} with a value of ${BUILD_NUMBER}-${BUILD_ID} will be
    sent to downstream build, for example:
    PARENT_BUILD_Infrastructure=2572-2011-05-11_23-59-59.
    The value of the parameter is also deployed to published artifacts as the property: build.parent.${JOB_NAME}.
    Downstream builds can add build.parent.${JOB_NAME}=${PARENT_BUILD_${JOB_NAME}} as a matrix parameter to their
    Artifactory URL, for example:
    build.parent.Infrastructure=${PARENT_BUILD_Infrastructure}
    to achieve isolated resolution from Artifactory - i.e. only resolve artifacts produced by the parent build run that
    triggered it, avoiding any artifacts produced by other runs of the parent build.
